Which web event did you hook into to update the display name? in case you have to use a name on an active directory user.
Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file? Are there better places? What's the best place? The <script> tag can be placed in the <head> section of your HTML, in the <body> section, or after the </body> close tag, depending on when you want the JavaScript to load.I personaly prefered up above the head section,but in case im uing JavaSript inside the HTML file I'll rather use it below the </body> tag.
Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file?. --Organiztion on your files, depending on the type is done, it will be necesary to write long lines of code in each file, making the editing work in a future  dificult.
